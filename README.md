# DADpy

The swiss army :knife: for discharge abstract database!

## About

DADpy provides a set of functions for using the DAD dataset for machine learning and visualization. The package does not include the dataset. Academic researchers can request the DAD dataset from CIHI. This is an unofficial repo, and I'm not affiliated with CIHI. Please retain the disclaimer below in forks.

## Installation

```

pip install https://github.com/E-Health/dadpy/releases/download/1.0.0/dadpy-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl
```

## Usage

```
from dadpy import DadLoad
from dadpy import DadRead
from dadpy import DadEmbedding

# with the trailing slash
dl = DadLoad('/path/to/dad/sample/spss/sav/file/') # clin_sample_spss.sav
dr = DadRead(dl.sample)
de = DadEmbedding(dl.sample)

# records with obesity as pandas df
print(dr.has_diagnosis('E66'))
# Partial gastrectomy for repair of gastric diverticulum
print(dr.has_treatment('1NF80')) 

# comorbidities as dict for visualization
print(dr.comorbidity('E66')) # Obesity
# co-occurance of treatments as dict
print(dr.interventions('1NF80')) # Partial gastrectomy for repair of gastric diverticulum

# Get the one-hot-encoded vector for machine learning
dr.vector(dr.has_diagnosis('E66'), significant_chars=3, include_treatments=True)

# Play with embeddings
print(de.embedding().most_similar_cosmul(['J90'])) #neighbours of 'pleural effusion' -> E877 Fluid overload.

## Development

* We use [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/).
* PR welcome. Please see CONTRIBUTING.md
* rename .env.example to .env and add path for tests to run
* Add jupiter notebooks to the notebook folder. Include the disclaimer below.
